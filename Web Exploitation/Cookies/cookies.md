<h2> Cookies </h2>

Here is the problem set:

<img src = "images/1.png" height = 400 width = 400>

1. At first I inspected the site, and clicked the storage tab, there I found value stores for the cookies which we would change. As I changed the value, the content displayed on the browser was also changed.

<img src = "images/2.png" height = 400 width = 400>, <img src = "images/3.png" height = 400 width = 400>

2. As I increased the value to 18, I got the flag. I learned it through various write-ups available.

<img src = "images/5.png" height = 400 width = 400>
